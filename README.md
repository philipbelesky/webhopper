# Webhopper

A CSS library and HTML implementation reference for representing [Grasshopper 3D](http://grasshopper3d.com) UI elements in a browser.

See [examples here](jekyll github page).

# Installation

- Import the CSS file or SASS file into your app

# Development

This uses [Astrum](https://github.com/NoDivide/astrum) to document and display the components. You will need node/npm installed.

To build a copy of this site locally, first install project dependencies:

    `npm install`

Then build the templates using Astrum

    `npm run astrum init library`

Then run the gulp task to start the local server:

    `npm run gulp`
